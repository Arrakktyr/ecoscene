">“Ecoscene” is a unique term adopted from the homonym “Ecocene,” which refers to a potential nearterm geologic epoch wherein humanity transitions from the broad-scale ecosystem destruction of the
            “Anthropocene” to world-wide Earth-stewardship and compassionate care for the entire global human
            family. ECOSCENE embodies the fulfillment of this “Ecocene” vision at its core, combined with the
            experience of a “scene” – a place, a community, and a cohort of like-minded people and organizations
            working toward the Ecocene. In other words, much like proliferating mycelia webworks in forest soil
            ecology, we are the growing global “regeneration renaissance” network responding to the call of love,
            kindness, regeneration, and stewardship – for ourselves, each other, future generations, and Mother
            Earth’s sacred ecosystems alike. </p>

">AN EVOLVED SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNITY… for GOOD</h3>

">ECOSCENE provides a refreshing alternative, a “safe place” and a digital ecosystem – social media for good
            – in which kindness, respect, reciprocity, and mutual-benefit guide our interactions. Instead of
            encouraging the rancor and vitriol all too common on conventional social media platforms (which are
            incidentally often deploying algorithms to further exacerbate this base behavior, all while singularly bent
            on maximizing profit extraction from people and companies), our evolved social media community
            instead embodies deep values and ethics of good-will, compassion, cooperation, collaboration, and
            conscious action.</p>

">Recognizing the tremendous contributions being made to the restoration of our world, to the generation
            of dignified livelihoods, and to the transformation of our economic systems being made by mindful and
            progressively led companies and organizations, we celebrate the products, services, proprietors, and
            companies that are deliberately contributing to our enhanced health, wellbeing, and prosperity while
            working to restore and regenerate Earth’s living ecosystems. With this foundation, ECOSCENE offers
            advertising, marketing, content-sharing, and story-telling opportunities exclusively to the mindful and
            responsible companies and practitioners who meet fair-trade, organic, regenerative, B-Certified, 1% for
            the Planet, and other third party social, governance, and environmental standards. </p>

        <p style="

">In addition to the social media community and commercial connections, ECOSCENE provides robust
            meeting, resource exchange, collaboration, and community-action tools for individuals, families,
            neighborhoods, faith and affinity groups, healing circles, and ecosystem restoration gatherings. By
            blending digital resources with real-life, grounded action, we are activating, amplifying, and celebrating
            the decentralized community and environmental restoration activities that are emerging world-wide and
            that need to be proliferated to realize the Ecocene vision.</p>
